Travel is a React-based web application that helps travelers manage their packing lists for various trips. Similar to a to-do app, you can add travel packages, each with a decription and quantity. You can also check off items as you pack them or delete item if you want. The app provides a footer that displays the total number of items in your list and the percentage of items that have been packed.

## Features
